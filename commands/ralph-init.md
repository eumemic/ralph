# Initialize Ralph in a Project

Run the init script to set up Ralph in the current project:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/init.sh"
```

This creates:
- `specs/` - Directory for specification files
- `specs/_TEMPLATE.md` - Example spec format
- `.ralph/config.yaml` - Configuration
- `.ralph/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Task list placeholder (generated by `ralph plan`)
